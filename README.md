## Branching - 10/01/2022
- Today we are going to learn about branching into git.
- first we should check total branches available in current repo working.
- the cmd is --> git branch
- now we will create a new branch --> git checkout -b (Name_of_branch)
- the term checkout will switch bet branchies.
- --> git checkout (Name of the branch) the branch to be switched
- diff compares two fies/program and shows the differences of changes.
